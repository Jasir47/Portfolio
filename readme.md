Hi, I'm jasir! I have a technical background and hold a Certificate in Data Analytics from Google. I have 6 months of experience in the field, where I held roles such as Junior Data Analyst in the course programme. After 6 months of transitioning from Software Engineer to Data Analytics , I am currently a Certified Data Analyst starting from June 2023.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics.
